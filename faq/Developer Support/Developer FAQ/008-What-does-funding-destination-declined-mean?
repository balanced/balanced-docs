According to the [Balanced API spec](https://github.com/balanced/balanced-api/blob/master/errors.rst), "funding destination declined" means that the processor did not accept the transaction. This can occur if the actual bank rejected the transaction for various reasons or Balanced's aggressive automatic fraud protection kicked in and flagged your transaction. Please email [support@balancedpayments.com](support@balancedpayments.com) to resolve your issue.
