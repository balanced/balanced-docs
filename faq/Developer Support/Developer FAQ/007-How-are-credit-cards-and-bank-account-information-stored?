 Credit cards and bank accounts are tokenized by Balanced and stored as URI's, so you can access them via the API without knowing any sensitive information. You will need to store credit card and bank account URI's, so that you can retrieve them at a later time. Here's more information on how to [retrieve a card](https://docs.balancedpayments.com/current/api?language=bash#retrieve-a-card) or how to [retrieve a bank account](https://docs.balancedpayments.com/current/api?language=bash#retrieve-a-bank-account).
