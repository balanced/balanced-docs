Q:  Are holds the new authorizations?  What's the difference between voiding a hold and refunding a debit?  Also, when refunding a debit, vs refunding a hold, how shall the fee structure work?

A:  A hold is never actually debited from the user's card; it is only reserved to be debited at a later date.  A debit will actually transfer funds to your Balanced account, and a refund does the reverse.  You can't refund a hold, as the money never gets pulled from the card.

Q: What is the difference between a hold and an escrow?

A: All debits flow into the "escrow balance", and all credits flow out of there. You can leave money in the escrow balance indefinitely. A hold is an authorization to charge a card for a certain amount of money, but the money hasn't been charged yet.(holds last for 7 days)
