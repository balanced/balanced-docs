Q:  Are holds the new authorizations?  What's the difference between voiding a hold and refunding a debit?  Also, when refunding a debit, vs refunding a hold, how shall the fee structure work?

A:  A hold is never actually debited from the user's card; it is only reserved to be debited at a later date.  A debit will actually transfer funds to your Balanced account, and a refund does the reverse.  You can't refund a hold, as the money never gets pulled from the card.
