Balanced validates bank routing numbers in real-time using the FedACH directory, but since bank accounts are not standardized, incorrect bank account numbers are not caught until the payout fails and Balanced is notified (3) three to (5) five business days after submission. Once a s uccessful payout has been made, future credits to that bank account will continue to take one business day when issued before the [next-day cut-offs](https://www.balancedpayments.com/docs/overview?language=bash#payouts-cutoff).
