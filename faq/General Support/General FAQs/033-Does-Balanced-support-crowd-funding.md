Yes! Balanced is commonly used to power payments for crowd-funding and group purchasing platforms. For example, [CrowdTilt](https://www.crowdtilt.com/), [Wanderable](https://wanderable.com/), [Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/), and many others are connecting Balanced Processing and Balanced Payouts to charge many buyersâ€™ credit cards on behalf of a single seller.
