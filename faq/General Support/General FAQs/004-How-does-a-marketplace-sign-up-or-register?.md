Marketplaces can [sign up](https://www.balancedpayments.com/marketplaces/start) at Balanced in a matter of minutes and have immediate access to a testing environment to see what transacting on Balanced would be like. All you need to do is meet the following three requirements: 1) U.S. bank account; 2) U.S. registered company with an EIN number; 3) a company representative that is a permanent U.S. resident.

When you are ready to go live, select the "Go Live" option at the top. Yes, it's that easy.
