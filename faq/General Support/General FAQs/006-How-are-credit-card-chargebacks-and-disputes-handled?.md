In the event that a buyer initiates a chargeback or dispute with the credit card issuer, Balanced will notify the Marketplace via email. The Marketplace should notify its seller/merchant of the dispute and request as much information as possible with which to fight the chargeback. The Marketplace should collect all the relevant information and provide it to Balanced within 15 days. Ideally the chargeback will be rejected in which case the Marketplace keeps the funds. If, however, the chargeback is successful, Balanced will debit the payment amount from the Marketplace's bank account. Depending on the Marketplace's policies and the nature of the dispute, the Marketplace may wish to pass on the chargeback amount to the seller.
