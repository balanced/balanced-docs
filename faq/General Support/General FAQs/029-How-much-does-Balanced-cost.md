Balanced's offers a straightforward, all-inclusive [pricing structure](https://www.balancedpayments.com/docs/overview?language=bash#pricing-and-fees). You pay 2.9% + 30¢ when you successfully charge a buyer’s credit card and 25¢ when you successfully payout to a seller’s bank account. That's it. No setup costs. No monthly contract. No hidden fees.
