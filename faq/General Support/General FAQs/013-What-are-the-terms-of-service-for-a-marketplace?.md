Marketplaces must agree to the Balanced's [Marketplace Agreement](http://www.balancedpayments.com/terms/marketplaceagreement`). An important term in the agreement is that the marketplace must include the following snippet of terms and conditions in its own Terms of Service which covers the relationship between the marketplace's customer and Balanced:

> [Client] uses Balanced as its third party service providers for payment services (e.g. card acceptance, merchant settlement, and related services).  By making use of some or all of these payment services on [Client] you agree to be bound by Balanced’s terms and conditions (available at [https://www.balancedpayments.com/terms](https://www.balancedpayments.com/terms) along with its privacy policy: [https://www.balancedpayments.com/privacy](https://www.balancedpayments.com/privacy)) and hereby consent and authorize us to delegate the authorizations and share the information you provide to us with our Third Party Service Provider(s) to the extent required to provide the Payment Services to you. Balanced may also be contacted directly for payments support either by email at [support@balancedpayments.com](support@balancedpayments.com) or by phone at +1 (888) 744-2622
