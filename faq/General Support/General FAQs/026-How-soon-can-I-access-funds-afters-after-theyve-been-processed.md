When you charge a credit card the funds are made immediately available within your escrow balance for you to disburse as required through next-business day ACH transfers. For example, if a buyer charges a card at 11am PST, the funds will be available in your account immediately, and so long as you call for a payout before 3pm PST the funds will be disbursed by the next day. Typically, our competitors require 7 days before funds are available for payout. With Balanced you can significantly alleviate your cash flow constraints and keep your merchants happy. Theyâ€™re your funds, you should be able to put them to use right away.
