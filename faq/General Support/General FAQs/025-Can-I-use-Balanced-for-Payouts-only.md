Yes! Balanced Payouts is a stand-alone service for sending money to your seller/vendor/merchant's bank account via the ACH network. You can issue a payout one of two ways: through the [Dashboard](https://www.balancedpayments.com/marketplaces/start) or [API](https://www.balancedpayments.com/docs/overview?language=bash#balanced-payouts
).
