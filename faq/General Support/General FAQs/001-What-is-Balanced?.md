Balanced is different from most "payments" models out there.  Balanced helps your company build its revenue stream by providing micro-merchant accounts directly to your marketplace's sellers.

The traditional "shopping cart" method optimizes for **one** seller with many buyers.  Or, in the case of Amazon / eBay, the seller is constrained by the Amazon / eBay "storefront", and is also required to pay all those listing and selling fees!  Some companies try to get around this by integrating PayPal directly into their sites outside of eBay, as a means for buyers and sellers to exchange payment.  But PayPal was not originally meant to do this; is not the best solution.

Balanced optimizes for many sellers with many buyers, and facilitates the growth of niche marketplaces where many buyers meet many sellers; even "the little guys" are able to efficiently get paid.  Some examples of partners using our core platform are:

Balanced creates commerce where commerce might not exist.   It enables companies large and small the ability to integrate our fraud-stopping, escrow-friendly, PCI-compliant, payments system directly into a site.

We handle all the hassle:  card authorization, escrow, fraud screening, chargeback processing, and best of all . . . payments!   No matter what size you are today, Balanced will scale with you.  Watch  your user base grow by leaps and bounds when you enable users to get paid doing what they do best.   Grow a user base's loyalty and love when get them paid directly with ACH direct deposit or even (for those very old school users) a paper check in the mail.
