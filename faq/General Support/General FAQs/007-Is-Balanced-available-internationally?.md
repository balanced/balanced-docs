At the moment, marketplaces and sellers (i.e. merchants) must satisfy the following 3 requirements to use Balanced: 1) U.S. bank account; 2) a company registered in the U.S. with an EIN number; 3) a company representative that is a permanent U.S. resident.

Balanced can process transactions from buyers residing in nearly any country and using any Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover card (debit and credit).
