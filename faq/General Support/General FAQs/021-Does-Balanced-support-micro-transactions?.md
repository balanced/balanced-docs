We have discussed offering micro-transaction pricing in the past, but reached the conclusion that it doesn't make sense for us financially at the moment. There are, however, work arounds that you could use. Our CEO discussed a few of these at length on [Quora](http://www.quora.com/Balanced/Does-it-make-sense-to-use-Balanced-with-micro-transactions/answer/Matin-Tamizi).
