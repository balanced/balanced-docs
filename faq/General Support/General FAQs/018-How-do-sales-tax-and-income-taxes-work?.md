Balanced does not get involved with the calculation of sales tax. The marketplace should determine if sales tax is applicable, the amount and include it in the total charge amount. As a Payment Service Provider, Balanced provides Form 1099K in certain situations, typically for sellers who exceed 200 transactions and $20,000 in transaction volume in one year.
