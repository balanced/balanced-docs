is_identity_verified is a verfication flag that we place on merchant accounts to indicate that the merchant has been underwritten. In order to underwrite a merchant we perform a check on the following provided parameters:

+ Name
+ Date of birth
+ Address
+ Last four of their social security number (SSN)
+ Phone number

Although the last four of their social security number is not required, it significantly improves the likelihood of a successful verification.
