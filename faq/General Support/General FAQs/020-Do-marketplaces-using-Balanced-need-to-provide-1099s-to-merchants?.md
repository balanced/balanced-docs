Marketplaces processing their merchantsâ€™ transactions through Balanced do not need to submit 1099s. Balanced, not the marketplace, is responsible for submitting tax forms to the IRS for all transactions that we process. Filings are only required for merchants processing >$20,000 from at least 200 transactions, and Balanced will submit a 1099-K to the IRS and the merchant.
