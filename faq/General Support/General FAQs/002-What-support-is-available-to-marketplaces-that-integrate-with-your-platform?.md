We offer real-time developer support, but end-user support is always the responsibility of the marketplace. Anything to do with missing shipments, order fulfillment (or lack thereof) or payment dispute needs to be handled by the marketplace.  We enable marketplaces the ability to handle refunds on your end.

If there are problems within the payments infrastructure, our team is ready to offer developer support.

Fraud alerts are another one of our large value-add services.  Our team is also always able to help with fraud investigation for suspicious transactions. We monitor payments for fraudulent activity throughout the escrow process.
