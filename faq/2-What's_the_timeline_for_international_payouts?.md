**Q:  Balanced is 100 percent compatible with payment acceptance from international cardholders  -- if you can "ship it" (literally or figuratively) international, you can collect payments from international cardholders.  But what about payouts for people outside the US?  Can Balanced pay out to to bank accounts that have been established outside the US?**

A:   At this time, our banking partners require that people receiving payout have a US bank account, which is linked to an EIN or SSN to track payments for tax purposes.  But this is a global world, so one of our top priorities is enabling service for other countries, specifically: Canada, Australia, the UK and the EU

**Q:  What's the timeline for going international?**

A:   We hope to have our first international payout options rolled out some time in 2013.
