We've become aware of an issue that affects many of our marketplace partners.   Some recent changes on the back end caused a glitch where some cards were "run" more than once for the same purchase.  Users might notice the same amount charged on two different dates corresponding to the same purchase.  Their accounts might even have been charged twice or three time for the same purchase.

First and foremost, we have already initiated the refund process for the cardholders affected.   But bank-processing takes time, so it's possible that it might be a couple or few days until the refunds show up and are fully processed.

The team is working hard to resolve this outstanding issue, and we'll keep you posted here about the progress.

Please accept our most profuse apologies for this mistake.  We're taking full responsibility and will be glad to follow up with any of our marketplace partners directly.   Reach out to us [support@balancedpayments.com](support@balancedpayments.com)
