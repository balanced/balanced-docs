Overview

About Balanced
--------------

Balanced is a payments company that enables entrepreneurs and developers
to create new and amazing e-commerce experiences. We’ve built a
white-labeled API and web-based dashboard to help them do this.
Specifically, we offer two products: Balanced Payouts and Balanced
Processing, which can be coupled. We really like working with
marketplaces and crowd-funding platforms, but Balanced can be used for
any type of e-commerce model. You should use Balanced to charge your
buyers’ credit cards and/or pay out to your sellers’ US-based bank
accounts via `ACH`_.

We’ve been processing live transactions since October, 2010 and have a
history of working closely with our customers to solve their problems,
specifically those related to multi-party transactions. For example,
we’re in an `open partnership`_ with `Gittip`_ after volunteering code
and expertise to help them `mitigate the risks of running a
marketplace`_. To date, Balanced has contributed to Gittip’s `payments
infrastructure`_, `visual design`_, and `fraud preventions systems`_.

Balanced believes in openness and transparency, so, despite being a
payments company, we try to discuss as much of our product development
decisions in public as possible. We’ve even `discussed pricing
decisions`_ publicly with our customers.

Github Issues
-------------

We actively and publicly discuss feature requests and product decisions
with our community on `github`_. We’d love to hear from you.


Popular Use Cases
-----------------

Marketplaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Balanced is most often used to power payments for online and mobile
marketplaces -- any platform facilitating payments between buyers and
sellers. For example, `kitchit`_, `copious`_, `zaarly`_, `visual.ly`_,
and many others are connecting Balanced Processing and Balanced Payouts
to charge a buyer’s credit card on behalf of a seller.

Some customers have even implemented a shopping cart checkout flow where
a single buyer can buy from many sellers with a single transaction. And
holding the funds with Balanced between Payouts and Processing can allow
the marketplace to implement an escrow-like functionality.

Crowd-funding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Balanced is commonly used to power payments for crowd-funding and group
purchasing platforms. For example, `crowdtilt`_, `wanderable`_,
`gittip`_, and many others are connecting Balanced Processing and
Balanced Payouts to charge many buyers’ credit cards on behalf of a
single seller.

Vendor Payments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Balanced Payouts is used by many businesses that need to pay their
sellers or vendors for supplies and services rendered.

e-Commerce
~~~~~~~~~~

Balanced Processing is used by a merchants to simply charge buyers for
items they sell directly.


Client Libraries
----------------

Balanced attempts very hard to write idiomatic code for all it's API libraries
and we pride ourselves in an extensive test suite for every client that
demonstrates almost every single method / function executed for your
convenience.

We find that this is the best way to use the client libraries. If you encounter
and issue, please file a github issue and get in touch through one our
many :ref:`support channels <support>`.

Invoicing fees
--------------

Balanced will create invoices to collect fees daily. These invoices can be
viewed under the ``invoices`` tab of the Balanced dashboard. These fees are
debited from the bank account attached to the owner account of the
marketplace. Please note that Balanced will never take fees from the operating
capital (escrow account) of the marketplace.

Example:
''''''''

- A buyer pays for a service on Monday from a third-party merchant. You charge
  the buyer $10, which increases your escrow balance by $10.

  * Balanced will invoice you, on Monday for 2.9% of $10 (or 29¢), plus 30¢,
    and debit your bank account for a total of 59¢.

- On Wednesday, the third-party merchant completes performing a service for the
  buyer, and the buyer acknowledges this. You credit out payment to the
  merchant, likely keeping a portion to pay your fees. Perhaps you pay out $7
  to the merchant, leaving you with $3 in your escrow account.

  * Balanced will invoice you, on Wednesday, 25¢ for this ACH credit.

- The $3 that is left from the buyer's $10 is your revenue from this order. You
  decide to credit this to your own bank account on Friday.

  * Balanced doesn't charge you for this credit, as credits to owner accounts
    are free.



Funds Flow
----------

It's important to understand how the funds flow works on Balanced. First and
foremost, when a charge occurs on Balanced, the amount you've charged your
user is the exact amount that shows up in the balance.

.. _mp.escrow:

Escrow
~~~~~~

Once a card is successfully charged your funds are implicitly in escrow for
your marketplace. This gives you complete control on funds disbursement.

You may choose to keep the money in escrow for as long as you desire
- but the common use case for this is to wait for any type of fulfillment
from your merchants -- such as confirmation of a shipped product or
completion of a service.

Since :ref:`Balanced Payouts <payouts>` delivers funds to your merchant within
one (1) business day, you can get a bit more creative as well. For example,
you may stagger the funds for disbursement at different times during the order
process - for example:

- A buyer has paid for a service
- Your merchant needs half of the payout amount as working capital
- You issue 50% of the amount you charged the buyer as a credit to the merchant
  using :ref:`Balanced Payouts <payouts>`
- The merchant performs the service and buyer is happy with the service
- You can pay the other half post completion of the service

In today's growing collaborative consumption economy, this model is extremely
powerful for providing marketplace liquidity to enable new forms of commerce.

Collecting Your Fees
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you've understood how incoming money comes in to Balanced and the
concept of implicit escrow, you might ask yourself, "where do I take my
cut?"

Since incoming funds are not touched by Balanced, you must issue a credit to
your own bank account with the funds you want for yourself -- that means you
must do the math to calculate the difference.

There are three common scenarios:

.. adding them to the buyer

1. adding your business' fee to the total amount charged during checkout

.. taking it from the merchant

2. with-holding some of the funds from the merchant and diverting those funds to yourself

.. both

3. doing both of these :)

Here are some examples that can clarify these scenarios, but first let's give
a little context:

Let's say you have a marketplace called **Rent\ My\ Bike** [#]_, which provides
a platform for bike owners, a.k.a. merchants, to put their bikes for rent by
renters, a.k.a. the buyers.

Recap:

- The bike owners are the merchants.
- The renters are the buyers.
- Your marketplace is called Rent My Bike

.. [#] Our sample marketplace is actually called `Rent My Bike`_ :)


Fee Scenario #1
'''''''''''''''

Your marketplace listing fee is 10%. So, say Alice lists her bike for 100.00$.
Bob decides to rent this bike - costing him $100.00.

- You charge Bob $100.00
- Your ``in_escrow`` balance now shows $100.00
- Alice delivers the bike to Bob
- You issue a $90.00 credit to Alice, using :ref:`Balanced Payouts <payouts>`

  -  Your listing fee is 10%, so 90% of $100.00 is $90.00

- Your ``in_escrow`` balance now shows $10.00
- You issue a credit to your own bank account, using :ref:`Balanced Payouts <payouts>`
- Your money is in your bank account next business day
- Alice's money is in her bank account next business day
- Your ``in_escrow`` balance now shows $0.00

Fee Scenario #2
'''''''''''''''

Your marketplace renting fee is 10%. So, say Alice lists her bike for 100.00$.
Bob decides to rent this bike - costing him $110.00.

- You charge Bob $110.00

  - Your renting fee is 10%, so $100.00 * 1.10 = $110.00 is how how much to charge Bob

- Your ``in_escrow`` balance now shows $110.00
- Alice delivers the bike to Bob
- You issue a $100.00 credit to Alice, using :ref:`Balanced Payouts <payouts>`
- Your ``in_escrow`` balance now shows $10.00
- You issue a credit for $10.00 to your own bank account, using :ref:`Balanced Payouts <payouts>`
- Your money is in your bank account next business day
- Alice's money is in her bank account next business day
- Your ``in_escrow`` balance now shows $0.00

Fee Scenario #3
'''''''''''''''

Your marketplace renting fee is 10%. You also charge a 10% listing fee.

So, say Alice lists her bike for 100.00$. Bob decides to rent this
bike - costing him $110.00.

- You charge Bob $110.00

  - Your renting fee is 10%, so $100.00 * 1.10 = $110.00 is how how much to charge Bob

- Your ``in_escrow`` balance now shows $110.00
- Alice delivers the bike to Bob
- You issue a $90.00 credit to Alice, using :ref:`Balanced Payouts <payouts>`

  -  Your listing fee is 10%, so 90% of $100.00 is $90.00

- Your ``in_escrow`` balance now shows $20.00
- You issue a credit for $20.00 to your own bank account, using :ref:`Balanced Payouts <payouts>`
- Your money is in your bank account next business day
- Alice's money is in her bank account next business day
- Your ``in_escrow`` balance now shows $0.00
