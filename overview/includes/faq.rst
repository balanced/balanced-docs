Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
=================================

How does a marketplace sign up/register?
----------------------------------------

Marketplaces can sign up at Balanced in a matter of minutes and have
immediate access to a testing environment. Balanced then needs just a bit more
information to move the account into production.

What are the cutoffs and holidays for Payouts?
----------------------------------------------

Payouts must be submitted by 3:00pm Pacific Time (PT) to be available on the
next business day. Holidays are not considered business days and so will delay
the payout by a day.

How are credit card chargebacks and disputes handled?
-----------------------------------------------------

In the event that a buyer initiates a chargeback or dispute with the
credit card issuer, Balanced will notify the Marketplace via email.
The Marketplace should notify its seller/merchant of the dispute and
request as much information as possible with which to fight the
chargeback. The Marketplace should collect all the relevant
information and provide it to Balanced within 15 days. Ideally the
chargeback will be rejected in which case the Marketplace keeps the
funds. If, however, the chargeback is successful, Balanced will debit
the payment amount from the Marketplace's bank account. Depending on
the Marketplace's policies and the nature of the dispute, the
Marketplace may wish to pass on the chargeback amount to the seller.

Is Balanced available internationally?
--------------------------------------

Sellers/merchants must reside in the US, have a US mailing address and
a US bank account. Buyers can reside in nearly all countries and use
any Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover card (debit and
credit).

How does Balanced invoice Marketplaces for fees owed?
-----------------------------------------------------

Balanced sums up fees on daily and bills them to
the primary bank account on file. Invoices are provided via the Balanced
Dashboard.


How does security and PCI compliance work?
------------------------------------------

Security is extremely important when handling credit card and bank
account information and processing financial transactions. PCI
Compliance is a set of rules created by the credit card companies
(Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover) that govern how
merchants are to handle credit card information and implement security
procedures. Balanced is certified as a Level 1 PCI Service
Provider. This means that it has been audited by a certified third
party auditor to attain the most stringent level of PCI Compliance. By
using Balanced Payments, sellers and marketplaces are able to
dramatically reduce the effort required to become PCI Compliant. A key
way this is made possible is use of Balanced's ``balanced.js`` JavaScript
library which sends a buyer's credit card information directly from
the web browser to Balanced, bypassing the marketplace's server and
thus avoiding the multitude of requirements that apply to
organizations handling credit card information.


What is SSL and how do I use it?
--------------------------------

SSL is a way to encrypt data when sending it over the internet.
Balanced enforces the use of SSL for all communications so you can be
assured of the privacy and security of all of your data and customer
information.


How does Balanced combat fraudulent activity?
---------------------------------------------

While Balanced utilizes a variety of powerful tools to detect fraud it
is impossible to wipe it out entirely. Marketplaces should also
evaluate the unique aspects of their services to help minimize
fraudulent activity such as by imposing limits on new customer
activity and monitoring the geo-location of users.


Can I export my data?
---------------------

Complete transaction data is always available for viewing and
downloading in the Balanced Dashboard.


Is credit card and bank account information portable?
-----------------------------------------------------

Marketplaces wishing to download customer credit card and bank details
should contact Balanced to arrange for the secure transfer of such
information.

What are the terms of service for a marketplace?
------------------------------------------------

Marketplaces must agree to the ``Balanced Marketplace Agreement``. And
important term in the agreement is that the marketplace must include a
snippet of terms and conditions in its own Terms of Service which
covers the relationship between the marketplace's customer and
Balanced.


What are the Terms of Use?
--------------------------

Please see Balanced Payments' Terms of Use.


Where can I get credit card logos and other useful images?
----------------------------------------------------------

Balanced provides credit card logos which you can download or serve
from Balanced's servers. Balanced also provides ``Powered by Balanced``
imagery which can help customers feel confident using the
marketplace's payment processing.


How are payment receipts handled?
---------------------------------

Balanced does not send out any receipts or emails for credit card
payments or bank payouts. The marketplace is responsible for all
communications to its customers.


Does Balanced offer volume discounts?
-------------------------------------

Yes! Please contact Balanced via email support@balancedpayments.com.


How do sales tax and income taxes work?
---------------------------------------

Balanced does not get involved with the calculation of sales tax. The
marketplace should determine if sales tax is applicable, the amount
and include it in the total charge amount. As a Payment Service
Provider, Balanced provides `Form 1099K`_ in certain situations,
typically for sellers who exceed 200 transactions and $20,000 in
transaction volume in one year.
