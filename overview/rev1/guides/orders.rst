Orders
============

.. note::
  :header_class: alert alert-tab-red
  :body_class: alert alert-red

  All new production marketplaces created after November 7th 2014, are
  required to link all debits and credits via the Orders resource to remain
  compliant. Not doing so can result in having your marketplace suspended.

An ``Order`` resource is a construct that logically groups related transaction
operations for a particular merchant (``Customer``).

The ``Order`` resource facilitates transaction reconciliation in the following ways:

  - each ``Order`` maintains an individual escrow balance, which is separate from the marketplace escrow
  - prevents over crediting funds by allowing payouts up to the ``amount_escrowed`` in each ``Order``
  - Flow of funds is trackable as funds credited from an ``Order`` are mapped to the ``Debits`` that brought the funds into it


.. admonition:: Requirements
  :header_class: alert alert-tab full-width alert-tab-yellow
  :body_class: alert alert-green alert-yellow

  - Funds must be paid to merchants within 30 days of the charge.
  - For each ``Order``, only one merchant and the marketplace may be credited.
