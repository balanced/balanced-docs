1099-K
-----------------

As a third party payments processor, on a yearly basis Balanced is obligated to
file a 1099-K for each seller that has completed 200 sales and totaling over
$20,000 in sales. This form reports seller name, address, Tax-Id, and gross
sales to help the IRS track persons who receive income selling on marketplaces
powered by Balanced.

Each year by Jan 31, for each Marketplace with at least 1 seller with over 200
sales and $20,000 in total sales, Balanced will send the Marketplace a report of
all Marketplace's Sellers that have met those requirements. This report includes
the following information:

- Seller Address for marketplace confirmation, whether seller has a listed Tax-Id or if the Marketplace or Seller must provide one.
- Seller Gross Amount
- Seller Gross Amount by Month

|

For each Sellers with over 200 sales and $20,000 Balanced will send a 1099-K form
listing:

- Their identifying information
- Contact information
- Balanced's address and phone number as the Filer, 4. but also indicating the Marketplace and Marketplace contact information
- The Gross amount of 2013 sales 
- Monthly breakdown of sales volume for 2013
- A note for sellers to contact us to correct any discrepancies they notice

By late February, after sellers and marketplaces have had an opportunity to
correct the 1099-K forms, Balanced will send the completed 1099-K forms to the
IRS.


Taxable Income
-----------------

Funds credited to bank accounts associated to your marketplace are considered 
income. Money in your marketplace escrow has not yet been collected by you as
income and therefore does not need to be reported as such.
