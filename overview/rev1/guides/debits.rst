Debits
=======================

A debit is a transaction where funds are obtained from a credit card or from a
bank account via the ACH Network. Funds obtained via credit card debits are
immediately available in escrow. Funds being obtained via ACH debits are
generally available in escrow in 3-4 business days. Currently Balanced supports
credit card debits as well as bank accounts debits via ACH. Marketplaces that
make use of ACH are advised to utilize a ``Callback`` (webhook) and listen for
``Events`` to be notified of status changes.

Debits have a ``status`` attribute representing the current status of the debit
throughout the payout process. There are three possible ``status`` values:
``pending``, ``succeeded``, ``failed``

  All new production marketplaces created after November 7th 2014, are
  required to link all debits and credits via the Orders resource to remain
  compliant. Not doing so can result in having your marketplace suspended.

Debit a credit card
----------------------

Let's go ahead and debit the buyer's card. First we'll fetch the buyer's card then debit (charge)
it for an ``Order``.

.. snippet:: card-debit


Debit a bank account
----------------------

Debiting a bank account (ACH) is very similar to debiting a credit card.

.. admonition:: Requirements
  :header_class: alert alert-tab full-width alert-tab-yellow
  :body_class: alert alert-green alert-yellow
  
  Bank accounts you wish to debit must first `be verified`_.


We'll first fetch the buyer's verified bank account then debit (charge) it for an ``Order``.

``Debits`` have a ``status`` attribute representing the current status of the debit process.

.. cssclass:: dl-horizontal dl-params dl-param-values dd-noindent dd-marginbottom

  ``pending``
    As soon as the debit is created through the API, the ``status`` attribute shows
    as ``pending``. This indicates that Balanced received the information for the
    debit and will begin processing. The ACH network itself processes transactions
    in a batch format. Batch submissions are processed at 3:30 PM Pacific Time on business days.
    If the debit is created after 3:30 PM Pacific Time, it will not be submitted for processing
    until **3:30 PM Pacific Time the next business day**.
  ``succeeded``
    After 3-4 days, the status will change to ``succeeded`` and the funds will be
    available in escrow. Note, even after a succeeded status, the status may still
    transition to failed even after a few weeks.
  ``failed``
    After 3-4 days, the status will change to ``failed`` if the transaction was
    not successful due to a problem such as an incorrect bank account number
    or insufficient funds.

.. note::
  :header_class: alert alert-tab-yellow
  :body_class: alert alert-yellow

  After a succeeded status, the status may still transition to failed, even
  after a few weeks.

Refunding a debit
-------------------

In the event that you need to cancel a payout, e.g. a user is not satisfied with
the product, you can create a ``Refund``.

A ``Refund`` resource represents a refund of a ``Debit`` transaction. The
amount of the refund may be any value up to the amount of the original
``Debit``. Refunds generally process in one day or less.

``Refunds`` have a ``status`` attribute representing the current status of the refund process.

A Debit may also be refunded from the `Dashboard`_.

.. cssclass:: dl-horizontal dl-params dl-param-values dd-noindent dd-marginbottom

  ``pending``
    As soon as the refund is created through the API, the ``status`` attribute shows
    as ``pending``. This indicates that Balanced received the information for the
    refund and will begin processing. The ACH network itself processes transactions
    in a batch format. Batch submissions are processed at 3:30 PM Pacific Time on business days.
    If the refund is created after 3:30 PM Pacific Time, it will not be submitted for processing
    until **3:30 PM Pacific Time the next business day**.
  ``succeeded``
    A ``succeeded`` status is displayed as the expected state of the refund one day after refund submission;
    however, there is no immediate confirmation regarding the success of the refund.
  ``failed``
    If the refund fails, Balanced will be notified in 1â€“4 business days. The status will update from
    ``pending`` to ``failed`` or ``succeeded`` to ``failed`` depending on when the failed notice is received.
