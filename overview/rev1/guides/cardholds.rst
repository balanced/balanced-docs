Card Holds
========================

Balanced supports the concept of holds. Holds are a type of
authorization that reserves a dollar amount on a credit card to be captured at
a later time, usually within 7 days. If the transaction is not processed
(known as post-authorization) by the end of the hold period, the amount is
released back to the available credit on the cardholder's credit card.
**The customer is not charged.**

Holds are common in the industries where the amount of the goods or services
are "reserved" on the cardholder's credit card or.

If you issue a debit on an account, Balanced uses holds behinds the scenes
but captures the funds immediately -- you will
**always see an expanded hold resource returned on a debit representation**.

  All new production marketplaces created after November 7th 2014, are
  required to link all debits and credits via the Orders resource to remain
  compliant. Not doing so can result in having your marketplace suspended.

  For all intents and purposes, Balanced does not recommend holds and considers
  their usage to be a very advanced feature as they cause much confusion and are
  cumbersome to manage.

A hold is created in a way similar to creating a debit. Creating a card hold
will return a href which can be used to perform a capture later, up to the full
amount of the card hold.
