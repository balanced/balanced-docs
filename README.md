## Setup

You'll first need:

* python 2.6+
* [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html)

And then you can setup your environment like this:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:balanced/balanced-docs.git
cd balanced-docs
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkvirtualenv balanced-docs
python setup.py develop
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you've done that before just do:

```bash
cd /path/to/balanced-docs
workon balanced-docs
git submodoule update --recursive
```

## Build

Now that your environment is setup, let's build the documentation. To build
them all at once do:

```bash
make all
```

### Specification

To build the [specification](https://github.com/balanced/balanced-api) do:

```bash
make spec
```

### Overview

To build the [overview](https://balancedpayments.com/docs/overview) do:

```bash
make overview
```

### Reference

To build the [reference](https://balancedpayments.com/docs/api) do:

```bash
make api
```

## Preview

Let's take a look at what we've built using [mongoose](https://github.com/valenok/mongoose):

```bash
cd site
./mongoose -ssi_pattern '**.shtml$|**.shtm$|**.html$'
Mongoose web server v. 3.8 started on port(s) 8080 with web root [.]
```

### Specification

Open up `http://localhost:8080/spec`

### Overview

Open up `http://localhost:8080/overview.shtml`

### Reference

Open up `http://localhost:8080/api.shtml`

## Hacking

### rST

All of the documentation is written in r(e)S(tructured)T(ext) which you can read
about [here](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html).

### dcode

We've added a custom rST directive called `dcode` which uses external scripts to
generate rST content. For example:

```
.. dcode:: scenario credit_create_new_bank_account
```

Here we are asking `dcode` to run the `credit_create_new_bank_account`. The
output for that `scenario` will end up in place of the directive.

You'll also see a corresponding `dcode-default` directive. For example:

```
.. dcode-default:: scenario
    :script: ../scenario.py -d ../scenarios -c scenario.cache
    :section-chars: ~^
    :lang: ruby
```

Which registers an external script for `scenario`. As a result the `dcode`
directive above will result in this call:

```bash
../scenario.py -d ../scenarios -c scenario.cache credit_create_new_bank_account --lang ruby
```

### Run individual scenario

```scripts/lang-scenario.py -d clients/curl hold_create
```
