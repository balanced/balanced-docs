Callbacks
=========

.. _callbacks:

Callbacks are a means of registering to receive payloads of information to a specific URL of your choice.
You may create multiple callbacks. Events will be sent to each callback URL. In the event that a 20x response
is not received when the payload is sent to the callback URL, the callback will be retried at increasing 
intervals and will eventually expire after several tries.
