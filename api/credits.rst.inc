credits
=======

To credit a bank account, you must create a new credit resource.


.. cssclass:: method-section

credit a new bank account
-------------------------

To credit a new bank account, you simply pass the amount along with the bank
account details. We do not store this bank account when you create a credit
this way, so you can safely assume that the information has been deleted.

.. cssclass:: method-section

credit an existing bank account
-------------------------------

To credit an existing bank account, you simply pass the amount to the
nested credit endpoint of a bank account. The ``credits_uri`` is a convenient
uri provided so that you can simply issue a ``POST`` with the amount and a
credit shall be created.
