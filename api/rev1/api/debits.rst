Debits
======

A ``Debit`` resource represents a transaction consisting of obtaining
(charging) money from a funding instrument, i.e, a ``Card`` or ``BankAccount``.

A debit can be created by debiting a ``Card`` or ``BankAccount`` directly.

Debits have a ``status`` attribute representing the current status of the debit
throughout the payout process. There are three possible ``status`` values:

.. cssclass:: dd-noindent dd-marginbottom

  ``pending``
    As soon as the debit is created through the API, the status shows
    as ``pending``. This indicates that Balanced received the information for the
    debit and will begin processing. The ACH network itself processes transactions
    in a batch format. Batch submissions are processed at 3pm PST on business days.
    If the debit is created after 3pm PST, it will not be submitted for processing
    until **3pm PST** the next business day.
  ``succeeded``
    After 3-4 days, the status will change to ``succeeded`` and the funds will be
    available in escrow.
  ``failed``
    After 3-4 days, the status will change to ``failed`` if the transaction was
    not successful due to a problem such as an incorrect bank account number
    or insufficient funds.
