Credits
=======

To credit a bank account, you must create a new credit resource.

**NOTE** If you're sending money to a bank account, known as issuing a credit,
you do **NOT** need to verify the bank account

Credit a New Bank Account
-------------------------

To credit a new bank account, you simply pass the amount along with the bank
account details. We do not store this bank account when you create a credit
this way, so you can safely assume that the information has been deleted.

Credit An Existing Bank Account
-------------------------------

To credit an existing bank account, you simply pass the amount to the
nested credit endpoint of a bank account. The ``credits_uri`` is a convenient
uri provided so that you can simply issue a ``POST`` with the amount and a
credit shall be created.
