errors
======

Standard HTTP status codes are used to communicate the success or
failure of a request. A code in the ``2xx`` range indicates success, ``4xx``
indicates an error that resulted from the provided information (e.g. a
required parameter was missing, a bank account failed tokenization, etc),
``5xx`` indicates an error with Balanced's servers. More: `List of errors`_.
