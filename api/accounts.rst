and bank accounts along with different financial transaction operations, i.e.
refunds, debits, credits.

Adding a Card to an Account
---------------------------

Adding a card to an account activates the ability to debit an account, more
specifically, charging a card.

You can add multiple cards to an account.

Balanced associates a ``buyer`` role to signify whether or not an account
has a valid credit card, to acquire funds from.

has a valid bank account to send money to.
