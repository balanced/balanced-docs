Debits
======

Currently, Balanced supports only card transactions (`info on ACH debits`_) for
debits. To debit an account, i.e. charge a card, you must create a new debit
resource.


.. cssclass:: method-section

.. _debits.create:

create a new debit
------------------

.. todo:: debit an account with different cards
.. todo:: debit an owner account

Debits an account. Returns a ``uri`` that  can later be used to reference this
debit.

Successful creation of a debit using a card will return an associated ``hold``
mapping as part of the response. This :ref:`hold <holds>` was created and
captured behind the scenes automatically. For ACH debits there is no
corresponding hold.

.. container:: method-description

  ``amount`` 
      *optional* **integer**. If the resolving URI references a hold then this is hold amount. You can 
      always capture less than the hold amount (e.g. a partial capture). 
      Otherwise its the maximum per debit amount for your marketplace. Value must be >= the minimum per debit ``amount`` for your 
      marketplace. Value must be <= the maximum per debit ``amount`` for your 
      marketplace.
   
  ``appears_on_statement_as`` 
      *optional* **string**. Text that will appear on the buyer's statement. Characters that can be 
      used are limited to: 
   
      - ASCII letters (``a-z`` and ``A-Z``) 
      - Digits (``0-9``) 
      - Special characters (``.<>(){}[]+&!$*;-%_?:#@~='" ^\`|``) 
   
      Any other characters will be rejected. Length must be **<=** ``22``. 
   
  ``meta`` 
      *optional* **object**. Single level mapping from string keys to string values. 
   
  ``description`` 
      *optional* **string**. Sequence of characters. 
   
  ``account_uri`` 
      *optional* **string**.  
   
  ``on_behalf_of_uri`` 
      *optional* **string**. The account of a merchant, usually a seller or service provider, that 
      is associated with this card charge or bank account debit. 
   
  ``merchant_uri`` 
      *optional* **string**. **Deprecated** The account of a merchant, usually a seller or service 
      provider, that is associated with this card charge or bank account 
      debit. Deprecated in favour of ``on_behalf_of_uri``. 
   
  ``hold_uri`` 
      *optional* **string**. If no ``hold`` is provided one my be generated and captured if the 
      funding source is a card. 
   
  ``source_uri`` 
      *optional* **string**. URI of a specific bank account or card to be debited. 
   
  ``bank_account_uri`` 
      *optional* **string**. **Deprecated** 
      This field is deprecated in favour of ``source_uri``. 
   
  ``card_uri`` 
      *optional* **string**. **Deprecated** 
      This field is deprecated in favour of ``source_uri``.
