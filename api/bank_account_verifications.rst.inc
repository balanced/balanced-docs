bank account verifications
==========================

Before you can debit a bank account you need to verify that you have access to
it. Balanced allows you to do this by creating a Verification for a
Bank Account which will result in two random amounts being credited into the
bank account. The amounts of these two deposits must be sent back as
the `amount_1` and `amount_2` params when subsequently updating this
verification. These deposits will appear on the bank accounts statement as
`Balanced verification`. (see `Confirm a Bank Account Verification`_).

If you fail to verify the bank account you must create a new verification and
begin the process again. You can only create one verification at a time and the
trial deposits should show in the bank account within 2 business days.
